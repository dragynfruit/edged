# Google Coral...

It's a love and hate relationship.

Just a warning: I will refer to Edged, my own driver for the Coral TPU, a good bit.

## Why "reverse engineering"? Isn't it open source?

While libedgetpu *is* open source, there's no public documentation on how it really works under the covers.
I have some more thoughts on libedgetpu's openness, but I'll get to those in later sections.
For now, assume it's a open driver w/ closed blob type of deal.
